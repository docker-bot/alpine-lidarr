An optional regular file named flag-essential. 
 The contents of this file are irrelevant, only its presence is tested. 
 If this file exists, the service will be marked as essential, which means that a s6-rc -d change foo command will not stop the service. 
 Only a s6-rc -D change foo command will. 
 If the service is a bundle, the flag will be propagated to all its contents, i.e. all the services it represents will be marked as essential.
